After making each bid a player puts their highest in the suit bid which they still have in their hand face-up on the table. If a player has no cards in the suit bid left, or after a notrump bid a player puts up
their highest card still in hand in total (or with multiple cards of the same rank the one in the highest ranked suit).

After passing, doubling or redoubling a player doesn't reveal any of their cards.

After the bidding is completed cards which are face-up remain face-up, after the opening lead the dummy lays all their cards as usual, other players play their cards on their own whether selecting a card face-up
or from closed hand.
