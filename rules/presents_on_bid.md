Before viewing the cards each player shuffles all of their cards, picks up 6 and keeps the other 7 face down in a pile, after making every bid at level X, doubling or redoubling a bid at X level they pick up X cards from their pile
(or all the cards left if there are fewer than X left). After the bidding is over the player to make the opening lead chooses on of the cards they already have in their hand, after the opening lead all players pick up all of their cards
and the play proceeds as usual.
