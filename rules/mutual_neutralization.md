If there are multiple cards of the same rank within a trick all such cards are neutralized. The trick is won by either highest non-neutralized trump if there are any, or the highest non-neutralized card of the suit lead, or by the player 
who lead to the trick if all trumps and cards of the suit lead are counted as neutralized.
