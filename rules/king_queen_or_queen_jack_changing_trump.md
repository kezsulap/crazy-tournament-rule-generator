If the king and the queen of the same suit are played to the same trick (whether they're both in the suit lead, or both in a different suit) this suit becomes the new trump suit for this and 3 subsequent tricks, if there's a queen and a jack
of the same suit for this and 3 subsequent tricks there are no trumps. After those 3 tricks pass the contract denomination is the trump suit again.
If there are more than one pair of matching cards in the same trick the last card played causing a matching pair takes effect, and if it's the queen with king and jack of the same suit already in there then the KQ pair takes prescedence
and this suit becomes the new trump.

Regardless of trump suit changing during the play the contract is scored as if it was played in the suit chosen during the bidding.
