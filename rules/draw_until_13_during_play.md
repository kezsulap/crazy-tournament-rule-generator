After the play before the opening lead all players except for the dummy shuffle all of their cards, draw random &(in_hand) and put the remaining &(rest) face down into a stack. The opening lead is made from one of those
cards now in hand, after that the dummy lays down all of their cards and declarer designates cards to play from dummy as usual, all other players play a card from cards they currently hold in hand, if they don't have
any cards in the suit lead they play a card of a different suit even if they still have some of the suit lead face down in their stack. After the trick is completed all players draw the top card from their stack until
all the stacks are exhausted.
