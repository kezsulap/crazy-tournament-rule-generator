Before the first lead every player except for the dummy lays down their cards face-down arranged by suits into 4 (possibly empty) columns ordered from highest to lowest, suits arranged from left to right by ranking. After all players 
put their hands and all agree to proceed to play they're not allowed to peek their cards again.
Every time a defender plays a card (including the opening lead) their partner orders them to play n-th highest card in a specified suit, declarer designates a card from the dummy as usual, and from hand by picking a face-down card and revealing
it.
