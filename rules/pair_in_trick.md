Any time declarer or dummy wins a trick which contains either of: at least 2 aces, at least 2 kings, at least 2 queens or at least 2 jacks it increases the total count of tricks won by 1, any time defenders
win such a trick it decreases the count by one. If the total after the play is completed is more than 13 it's truncated to 13, if it's less than 0 it's truncated to 0.

If a trick contains 3 or 4 cards of the same rank, or 2 pairs it still counts as one.
