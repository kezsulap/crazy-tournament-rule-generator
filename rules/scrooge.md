If any player (counting declarer and dummy as 2 separate players) wins 3 tricks in a row then their opponent (declarer if it was either of the defenders, or the defender on the right of the player concerned if it was dummy or declarer) chooses
any suit to be the trump from now on (can select to keep the current suit, can select NT). Regardless of trump suit changing during the play the contract is scored as if it was played in the suit chosen during the bidding.
