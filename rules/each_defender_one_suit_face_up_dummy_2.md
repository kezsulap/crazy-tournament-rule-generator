After the opening lead the player who was on the lead lays down all their &(suit1)s face up on the table, the player who was supposed to be the dummy all their &(suit2)s and &(suit3)s, the other defender all of their &(suit4)s.

Whenever a player with any cards left face-up is to play a card the procedure goes as follows:
- If they're to lead the first card to a trick their partner either selects a face-up card, or orders them to select a card from their closed hand
- If they're to follow to a trick
    - If they have a card face-up of the same suit, their partner selects one
    - Otherwise if they have any cards of the suit lead in their closed hand they select one of them themselves
    - Otherwise they announce they don't have a card to follow and their partner either selects a face-up card or orders them to select a card from their closed hand
