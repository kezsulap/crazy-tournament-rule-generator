For the first &(count) tricks each player can only play their lowest or highest card in a suit and they announce if they played the lowest or the highest (when playing a singleton they're allowed to say either of the two).
Whatever one of the player chooses their partner is required to do the opposite. This includes not following the suit, in such case a player chooses the suit, but is still required to play their lowest or highest card in
chosen suit (in particular if their partner has already played their lowest/highest regardless of whether they followed the suit or not, the player is now also required to play their highest/lowest card in some suit other than suit lead).

For the remaining &(remaining) tricks play proceeds under ordinary rules.
