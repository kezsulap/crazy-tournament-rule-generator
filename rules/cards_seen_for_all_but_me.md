Before viewing the cards each player shuffles all of their cards, picks &(rest) of them at random, views them, and holds remaining &(shown) in such a way that all players except for them can see them.

After the bidding is completed the player who would be on the lead according to standard rules can either lead one of their &(rest) seen cards, or order their partner to lead one of their &(shown) face-up cards,
after that the dummy lays down their hand as usual, all other players keep put their already revealed cards face-up on the table and when it's their turn to play a card they can play any card from either
their face-up cards, or their closed hand.
